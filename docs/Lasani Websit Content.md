Hydraulic Line Pipe
HPL Tubes are seamless cold-drawn precision steel tubes primarily used as pressure lines in hydraulic or pneumatic systems. These tubes experience fluctuating stresses due to changes in velocity and pressure of the medium under operating conditions, leading to pressure surges that combine with static internal pressure. The design of these tubes must account for the actual stress conditions experienced during service. For applications requiring reduced weight or high operating pressures, specialised solutions are available. Additionally, there are options for enhanced corrosion protection to ensure long-term durability. These tubes comply with the EN 10305-4 standard for hydraulic and pneumatic systems and available in E355/E235 +N.

Equipment List


### 2.1 Deep Hole -BTA Drilling
Deep hole drilling ensures accurate, straight holes with high depth-to-diameter ratios, suitable for complex components in the oil & gas, military, and aerospace industries. Our advanced CNC-controlled drilling systems maintain strict tolerances, minimising deviation and achieving high-quality finishes. With coolant-fed tools and specialised techniques, we prevent workpiece deformation and maintain material integrity.

### 2.2 Gun Drilling
Our gun drilling capabilities are ideal for creating small, deep holes with exceptional straightness and finish, often required in hydraulic and medical components. Utilising a single-flute design, our process delivers precise diameter control and minimal burr formation. Our state-of-the-art equipment ensures optimal tool life and efficiency, reducing overall production costs and enhancing part quality.

### 2.3 Trepanning
Trepanning efficiently removes a solid core from the centre of a workpiece, reducing material waste and lowering production costs. This process is perfect for large bore holes in heavy components, such as those used in mining, petrochemical, and military sectors. Trepanning also allows for the recovery and reuse of core material, maximising resource utilisation.

### 2.4 OD Turning
OD turning services provide precision shaping and finishing of cylindrical parts, ensuring tight concentricity and roundness tolerances. This process is critical for applications requiring uniform diameter and high surface quality, such as shafts, rollers, and spindles. Our equipment supports high-speed machining, optimising cycle times and reducing costs.

### 2.5 Boring and Fine Boring
Our boring capabilities focus on creating precise internal diameters with excellent surface finishes and alignment. This process is essential for parts that demand exact internal fits, such as bearings, bushings, and hydraulic cylinders. We utilise advanced tooling and process control to maintain dimensional accuracy and repeatability across all production runs.

Fine boring ensures high-precision internal diameters with enhanced surface finish, suitable for applications where alignment and dimensional control are critical. Our skilled machinists use advanced boring tools and techniques to minimise tool deflection and maintain consistent quality, making it ideal for precision-engineered parts like engine blocks, valves, and hydraulic cylinders.

### 2.6 Honing
Honing refines the surface finish of bores, improving dimensional accuracy, roundness, and surface texture. This process is particularly beneficial for hydraulic cylinders, where tight sealing and reduced friction are essential. Our honing services ensure optimal part performance by achieving consistent micro finishes and superior bore geometry.

### 2.7 Burnishing
Burnishing enhances surface finish and mechanical properties by cold working the surface, eliminating scratches, and increasing hardness. It is ideal for applications requiring high surface integrity, such as automotive shafts and rods. The process results in a low Ra value, extending component life and improving fatigue resistance.

### 2.8 Grinding
Precision grinding provides the highest levels of dimensional accuracy and surface quality, essential for critical components in aerospace, medical, and military applications. Our grinding services accommodate complex geometries and tight tolerances, ensuring parts meet stringent quality standards. We offer both surface and cylindrical grinding to suit diverse application requirements.
