# Services — Precision Machining & Cylinder Repair

Intro: Our ISO 9001:2015–aligned facility delivers consistent accuracy and repeatability across key machining operations.

## Core Capabilities
- **Deep‑Hole / Gun Drilling** — High straightness with long OAL capability  
- **Boring & Trepanning** — Controlled ID growth and wall thickness balance  
- **Honing & Roller Burnishing** — Tolerances to H8/H9 and finishes up to Ra ≤ 0.40 µm  
- **Grinding & Super‑Finishing** — For rods, plates and critical interfaces  
- **Cylinder Repair Programs** — All types restored to function with QA traceability

## Typical Technical Ranges (Guide)
- **Deep‑Hole Drilling:** Mid to large IDs; OAL up to several meters depending on grade and setup  
- **Honing:** ID up to ~700 mm; OAL up to ~14,000 mm (application‑dependent)  
- **Plated Rod Processing:** Ø 12–160 mm typical

(Exact ranges are confirmed at enquiry stage; tolerances and surface finishes are validated per drawing.)
